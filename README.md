# Emote Screensaver

Generate a DVD-style bouncing emote overlay for your live stream with a single click.

Built in a way that allows streamers to **_change emotes and other settings directly in OBS_** without needing to mess with strange URL parameters or visit the original website manually.

### Instructions

- Add a new browser source to OBS using your personalized channel URL.
- With the new source selected, click the "interact" button to view the page in interactive mode.
- Click anywhere on the screen to open and change your settings.

Leave the option "Shutdown source when not visible" unchecked or the page will break after switching scenes.
